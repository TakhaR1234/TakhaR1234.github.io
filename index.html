    <h1>Welcome to My CS-499 Portfolio</h1>
    <p>This page hosts my enhanced artifacts, code review, and professional self-assessment that showcase my skills in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Software Engineering & Design</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Algorithms & Secure Coding</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Databases & Full Stack Development</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p><em>My ePortfolio showcases the technical, problem-solving, and communication skills I have developed throughout the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University. Through my enhanced artifacts, I demonstrate proficiency in software engineering and design, algorithms and data structures, and databases. These enhancements not only improved the functionality and quality of the original work but also aligned with professional best practices in coding, security, and usability.

One of my strengths is the ability to design and implement solutions that integrate multiple components into a cohesive system. In my Software Design and Engineering artifact, I incorporated input validation, permission-based logic, and a user-friendly interface, showing my capability to create robust and maintainable code. In my Algorithms and Data Structures artifact, I refactored a C++ encryption/decryption program into an object-oriented design, improving modularity, error handling, and efficiency. For the Databases category, I enhanced a full-stack Animal Shelter Dashboard that connected a MongoDB backend to an interactive Dash interface, adding validation, role-based access control, and planning for a MySQL migration.

These projects reflect my ability to:

Apply innovative techniques in software development.

Use secure coding practices to protect data and system integrity.

Optimize algorithms and queries for performance and scalability.

Communicate technical concepts clearly for different audiences.

Completing these enhancements has reinforced the importance of planning, testing, and iteration in building professional-quality solutions. It has also helped me think critically about trade-offs in design decisions, such as balancing security, usability, and performance.

Moving forward, I will continue to build on these skills by exploring advanced cloud-based deployments, data visualization techniques, and additional programming languages. My goal is to contribute to projects that require a combination of backend logic, database integration, and engaging user interfaces â€” delivering solutions that are both technically sound and user-centered.</em></p>
